## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a traditional multi-page static website architecture using vanilla HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Key architectural decisions include:

**Static Site Structure**: The site uses separate HTML files for each major section (index, blog, about, contact, post, category) to provide clear navigation and SEO benefits. This approach was chosen for simplicity, fast loading times, and easy deployment without server-side dependencies.

**CSS-First Design System**: A comprehensive CSS architecture built around CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming and easy maintenance. The design system includes:
- Centralized color palette and typography scale
- Reusable component classes (cards, buttons, grids)
- Responsive grid layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

**Component-Based CSS**: The stylesheet follows a modular approach with clearly defined sections for different UI components, making it easy to maintain and extend the design system.

### Content Strategy Architecture
**SEO-Optimized Structure**: Each page includes proper meta descriptions, keywords, and semantic HTML structure to maximize search engine visibility, which is crucial for an affiliate marketing blog.

**Category-Based Organization**: Content is organized around product categories (tech, lifestyle, tools) to help users discover relevant reviews and improve site navigation.

**Affiliate Disclosure Integration**: Built-in affiliate disclosure components ensure transparency and compliance with FTC guidelines for affiliate marketing.

### Performance Considerations
**Image Optimization**: Uses Unsplash CDN for images with proper sizing parameters to ensure fast loading times while maintaining visual quality.

**Minimal Dependencies**: No external JavaScript frameworks or complex build processes, ensuring fast loading and easy maintenance.

## External Dependencies

### Content Delivery
- **Unsplash API**: Used for high-quality product and lifestyle images throughout the site
- **Google Fonts**: Provides the Inter and Poppins font families for typography

### Future Integration Points
The current architecture is designed to easily accommodate:
- **Analytics platforms** (Google Analytics, etc.) for tracking user behavior
- **Affiliate network APIs** for dynamic product data and commission tracking
- **Email marketing services** for newsletter functionality
- **Content Management Systems** for easier content updates
- **Search functionality** for improved user experience

The static nature of the current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be gradually enhanced with dynamic features while maintaining performance and SEO benefits.
